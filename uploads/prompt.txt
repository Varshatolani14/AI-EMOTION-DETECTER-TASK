**Please read the notes at the end
_____________________

Here are four quick prompts to customise that CV like a pro!

📌For Skills Section👇🏽:
“Draft a highly optimised skills section for my CV that covers all the skills required for this job in two sub sections: Functional Competencies and Technical tools, make sure not to miss any keyword that the ATS might scan for and refer to the job description below to draft the section and pick skills keywords: (Insert Job Description)”
“Please write it in short, in a list format, separated by vertical bars, following this example:
-Functional Competencies: Data Analysis| Project Management| Etc.
-Technical Tools: SQL| Python”
📌Keyword Optimisation👇🏽
Below is a job description for a role that i'm interested in, kindly parse it and provide me with a list of top 15 keywords in the order of priority that should be in my CV to impress the recruiter and ensure that my CV passes the ATS keyword scan. (Paste the JD)”
Once ChatGPT spills these keywords out, just spread them throughout your CV, ensuring that they are impactful and make sense
📌Professional Summary👇🏽
“Write a compelling 3-line professional summary for my CV using an achievement-oriented tone. Within the summary, you need to give evidence of my success as a candidate in the roles I plan on applying. You can use multiple evidence, but make sure each of the three lines has evidence. Use evidence from my work experience (paste worked)
